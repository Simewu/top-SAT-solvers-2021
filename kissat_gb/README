KISSAT is a "keep it simple and clean bare metal SAT solver" written in C.
It is a port of CaDiCaL back to C with improved data structures, better
scheduling of inprocessing and optimized algorithms and implementation.

Coincidentally 'kissat' also means 'cats' in Finnish.

Run './configure && make test' to configure, build and test in 'build'.
